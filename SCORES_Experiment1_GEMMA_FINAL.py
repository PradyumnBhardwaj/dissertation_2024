About 4 months ago, I started to notice a slight vibration in the steering wheel. It was very slight and only noticeable when I was driving on the highway. The vibration was not noticeable at all when driving around town. At first, it was only when the vehicle was cold. After driving for a while, the vibration would go away. However, over the past 6 weeks, this vibration has gotten worse. Now, even when my vehicle is warm, there is a vibration when going over 50 mph. When I am driving at 70-75 mph, my steering feels like it is shaking. This vibration is not constant.",
